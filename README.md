- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Niki Ryom Hansen, a Danish, overly-positive, always smiling, ambitious guy.

- On a daily basis I work at the Danish Meteorological Institute as a System Developer. A normal work day for me consists of working together with climatologists whom I 
develop applications to or provide data to, from meteorological observations (very simplified).
At my job I mostly work in Java, PostgreSQL and MySQL

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a bunch of technologies, my current interest is the MERN stack where I'm currently the process of developing a mobile app - 
A climbing tracker to track what you've climbed, where you've climbed, challenge your friends etc. Just a project I'm having fun with in my freetime.

- I have an AP degree in computer science and have been working full-time since the end of my studies in the start of 2021.
